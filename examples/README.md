# Example for bib-url-linker


The [CSL file](https://github.com/alexanderkoller/typst-bib-url-linker/blob/main/examples/association-for-computational-linguistics.csl) is a modified version of the [official CSL style](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) for ACL publications (see also [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/)). It is redistributed here under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

I have modified the ACL CSL file as described in the [main README](https://github.com/alexanderkoller/typst-bib-url-linker), by replacing all uses of the title variable with a magic symbol encapsulating the citation key.
